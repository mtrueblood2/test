	    <p class="lead w-75">I'm a programmer, but what I really love to work on is solutions to problems. Whether it's finding a way to streamline a business process, make a system trackable, or just give people more control over their day I love being able to improve things. Programming is my way to contribute and I take it very seriously. I love writing clean, maintainable code and I am comfortable using PHP, C#, Java, and a whole host of other languages and platforms. I'm comfortable working on the command line remotely and think that the cloud is going to continue to allow us to revolutionize.</p>
	    <p class="lead w-75">When I'm not programming I can usually be found enjoying time with my family, playing guitar, or video games. I love travelling with my family and since we love the outdoors we usually find ourselves in national parks. As a former restaurant owner I love to cook, and my wife and I are always trying to cook food we have never had before.</p>
